# device-provisioner
This ÂµONOS platform component is responsible for:
1) maintaining an inventory of pipeline and chassis configurations and 
2) for applying these configurations to the network devices using P4Runtime and gNMI, respectively.

## Configurations API and Store
The component offers a gRPC API through which clients can manage the inventory of configurations.
Each configuration has a unique name, kind (e.g. `pipeline`, `chassis`) and an accompanying set of binary artifacts.

* Pipeline configurations are expected to have two artifacts:
  1) `p4info` - proto text of the P4Info structure
  2) `p4bin`- architecture-specific binary
* Chassis configuration has only one artifact:
  1) `chassis`- proto text to be applied to the root path

The configuration records are tracked using an Atomix distributed map primitive,
while the binaries for the configuration artifacts are stored on a shared persistent volume.

## Reconciler
In addition to providing a management gRPC API, the provisioner also runs a configuration reconciliation controller,
which is responsible for applying the configurations to the devices. Its operation is driven
by `onos.provisioner.DeviceConfig` aspect, which is expected to be attached to topology 
entities representing the devices that are to be configured.

```protobuf
// DeviceConfig is a topology entity aspect used to specify what pipeline and chassis 
// config a device should have applied to it
message DeviceConfig {
  string pipeline_config_id = 1 [(gogoproto.customname) = "PipelineConfigID", (gogoproto.casttype) = "ConfigID"];
  string chassis_config_id = 2 [(gogoproto.customname) = "ChassisConfigID", (gogoproto.casttype) = "ConfigID"];
}
```
The state of the reconciliation for each device is then in turn maintained using 
`onos.provisioner.PipelineConfigState` and `onos.provisioner.ChassisConfigState` aspects,
which record the result of the last successful device configuration. 

```protobuf
// PipelineConfigState is a topology entity aspect used to indicate what pipeline config
// a device has presently applied to it
message PipelineConfigState {
  string config_id = 1 [(gogoproto.customname) = "ConfigID", (gogoproto.casttype) = "ConfigID"];
  uint64 cookie = 2;
  google.protobuf.Timestamp updated = 3 [(gogoproto.stdtime) = true, (gogoproto.nullable) = false];
}

// ChassisConfigState is a topology entity aspect used to indicate what chassis config
// a device has presently applied to it
message ChassisConfigState {
  string config_id = 1 [(gogoproto.customname) = "ConfigID", (gogoproto.casttype) = "ConfigID"];
  google.protobuf.Timestamp updated = 2 [(gogoproto.stdtime) = true, (gogoproto.nullable) = false];
}
```

## Realms
Multiple instances of the provisioner can be run and cooperate using the same configurations 
Atomix store and persistent volume, while dividing their responsibilities for applying those
configurations to mutually distinct set of devices. Such partitioning is achieved by applying
a realm label with a particular realm label value to each device entity.

Each instance of the provisioner then needs to be started with the same `--realm-label` (e.g. `pod`)
and a unique `--realm-value` (e.g. `pod-01`).

The reconciler will only concern itself with configuring devices whose topology entities have 
that label/value combination.
